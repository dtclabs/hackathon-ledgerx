/**
 * LedgerX Public API
 * ## Introduction  The LedgerX API provides endpoints for synchronizing on-chain wallets, retrieving normalized financial transactions, and managing wallets, wallet groups, organization members, and the accounting system (Chart of Accounts).  - **Security**: All endpoints (unless otherwise specified) require an **API_KEY**   in the request header. - **Rate Limit**: Depends on the user’s subscription plan. See details on the   subscriptions page. - **Compute Unit (CU)**: Each API consumes a specific number of CUs, which are   deducted from your monthly total.  **Useful Links**: - Rate limit: https://ledgerx.finance/subscriptions - Compute Unit: https://ledgerx.finance/subscriptions  > Note: Some CU and rate limit descriptions are for documentation purposes only. Actual limits are applied based on the user’s subscription plan.
